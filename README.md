# Finding Pi

This repo was created inspired by [Matt Parker's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A) weird and awesome passion for finding pi in interesting creative ways.

## Ways of finding Pi

### 1. Co-prime Random Numbers

This first method is taken directly from [one of Matt's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZBhSi_PwHU). Basically the idea is to find pi experimentally through the probability that given two random numbers they'll be co-prime. This can be proven to be 6/(pi^2). You can see the proof given by Matt on his video.
